# Analysis of the di-muon spectrum using data from the MC simulation

Reproduction of the Analysis of the weak mixing angle using the forward-backward asymmetry of Drell–Yan events in p$\bar{p}$ collisions at 8 TeV.
Analysis using reduced files created from Montecarlo Simulation open data producing di-muon spectrum, the histogram of $\theta$* (the angle of the negative muon relative to the axis that bisects the angle between the direction of the quark and the reversed direction of the antiquark) and the forward-
backward asymmetry ($A_{FB}$) histogram in function to the invariant mass.

## How to run this?

The analysis needs solely a ROOT installation (6.16 or greater). You have to download a set of datas from this site:

```bash
[source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/LCG_95/x86_64-slc6-gcc8-opt/setup.sh](https://eospublichttp01.cern.ch/eos/opendata/cms/derived-data/NanoAODRun1/01-Jul-22/MonteCarlo11_Summer11LegDR_DYJetsToLL_M-50_7TeV-madgraph-pythia6-tauola)
```

Just run the filter_df.cpp with:

**Root (interactive):**

```bash
root[0] .L filter_df.cpp
root[1] filter_df()
```
or 

```bash
root -l "filter_df.cpp(\"00C074C0-1C19-4933-9407-5A05484E1F1E.root\")"
```

then you'll create the file `Events.root`, where there are some filtered columns of the initial dataframe. Be sure in the first dataset there are the following columns:

```bash
nMuon
Muon_charge
Muon_mass
Muon_eta
Muon_phi
Muon_pt
Muon_dxy
Muon_pfRelIso03
```

The analysis code itself is provided in C++. There are different files for each macro. The instructions to run the scripts is shown below:

**Root (interactive):**

```bash
root[0] .L dimuon_spectrum_Z.cpp
root[1] dimuon_spectrum_Z()
```

or 

```bash
root[0] .L costheta.cpp
root[1] costheta()
```

or

```bash
root[0] .L afb.cpp
root[1] afb()
```

**C++ (interactive):**

```bash
root -l dimuon_spectrum_Z.cpp
```
or

```bash
root -l costheta.cpp
```

or

```bash
root -l afb.cpp
```


Download also the "images" folder and its content to be able to save histogram. Otherwise change the path on the macros programs.
You can also change the threads number in function 

```bash
ROOT::EnableImplicitMT()
```
depending on your system.

**C++ (compiled):**

Note that you have to select the compiler based on your system.

```bash
g++ -O3 -o dimuonSpectrum dimuonSpectrum.C $(root-config --cflags --libs)
./dimuonSpectrum
```
