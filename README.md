# Analysis of the di-muon spectrum using data from the MC simulation

Reproduction of the Analysis of the weak mixing angle using the forward-backward asymmetry of Drellâ€“Yan events in p\bar{p} collisions at 8 TeV.
Analysis using reduced files created from Montecarlo Simulation open data producing di-muon spectrum, the histogram of \theta* (the angle of the negative muon relative to the axis that bisects the angle between the direction of the quark and the reversed direction of the antiquark) and the forward-
backward asymmetry (A_{FB}) histogram in function to the invariant mass.

## How to run this?

The analysis needs solely a ROOT installation (6.16 or greater). You have to download a set of datas from this site:

```bash
source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/LCG_95/x86_64-slc6-gcc8-opt/setup.sh
```

Just run the filter_df.cpp, if you haveTo download the files, you can either use `git` with the following command or download them directly via the web browser.

```bash
git clone git://github.com/cms-opendata-analyses/DimuonSpectrumNanoAODOutreachAnalysis -b v1.4
```

The analysis code itself is provided in Python and C++. The instructions to run the scripts is shown below:

**Python (notebook):**

The notebook can either be run locally or via [binder](https://mybinder.org/) in the browser. To run locally, use the following command.

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

To run via binder, you just have to click the following link and follow the instructions. You can ignore the two error messages.

**Python (interactive):**

Note the `-i` flag, which keeps the Python interpreter alive after the end of the script so that the interactive plot can still be explored.

```bash
python -i dimuonSpectrum.py
```

**C++ (interactive):**

```bash
root -l dimuonSpectrum.C
```

**C++ (compiled):**

Note that you have to select the compiler based on your system.

```bash
g++ -O3 -o dimuonSpectrum dimuonSpectrum.C $(root-config --cflags --libs)
./dimuonSpectrum
```
